I'm Sviatoslav, a full-stack developer with three years commercial exp. My strong foundation in C, C++, and advanced mathematics, along with a degree in hardware programming, equips me to develop high-performance applications from start to finish.

In frontend development, I have expertise in React and Next.js frameworks, complemented by a deep understanding of JavaScript (at a level akin to C), HTML, and CSS.

On the backend, my experience spans three years, initially in C# but later transitioning to Python for faster service development. I'm also skilled in Golang and PHP, with a focus on creating both CRUD applications and intricate microservices.

I possess proficiency in essential tools such as Git, Jira, Linux, SQL, NoSQL, Docker, Celery, Redis, and bash scripting.

My programming proficiency includes JS (ES5-6+), TS, Python, C#, C++, FBD, Golang, and Rust, all of which I've mastered to ensure optimal performance and efficiency.
